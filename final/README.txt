This program is a python script that composes music in the form of algorithmic composition. It creates music of a random tempo and pitch that is roughly a minute long. It has other random aspects that allow for differentiation between other similarly generated pieces. TThese include likelihood to repeat sections, to extend the bass notes, and to divide and or skip notes in the highest pitch. The program also generates one of 5 different drum tracks to accompany the music. 

From a more technical aspect, the program creates thresholds for various values with a random number call. It also uses a number of hard coded arrays to determine intervals that should be avoided and intervals to use depending on the chosen scale. The program does not have a gui or any input values. It is just run from the command line and generates a midi file with two tracks called "MIDIOut". It is recommended to change the second track's instrument to a drum set to get the full effect.
